                <em id="underline"> Sustainable Service Volunteer Committee </em>
                which supports many student led service programs in KIS. Through a
                proposal and meetings with the school administrator, we are starting
                on a first a rt related service program that interacts with people
                with mental disabilities. I am contacting one of the teachers who
                have more experience with people with mental disabilities for a
                training session for the members who will join this program, so that
                they can learn to interact with people with mental disabilities and
                act wisely in unexpected situations.

                I regularly cleaned and organized the studio to start each session.
                After that, Ms.Cone and I planned art projects. For these projects,
                I research and present artworks/artists that may be relevant to the
                project or inspire the students. Moreover, I helped organize the
                schedule and the events (face painting, working backstage for the
                musical, planning exhibits) for the Fine arts week, one of the
                biggest events for the Art department. Lastly, I helped set up for
                the annual art show. At the end of service, I received an
                acknowledge of service from KIS.

                I connected the creative studios with NAHS to provide art students

                decorate the walls and the bulletin board around school and raise
                awareness in art by participating in activist campaigns around
                school, supporting issues such as women’s and minority rights.

                I select members for the entire team and organize smaller groups for
                each performance through audition. I also communicate and receive
                performance requests from other clubs or school events. Then, I
                communicate with the school administrators to get approval of the
                performance. I choreograph or edit and learn dances from the video
                of selected songs; arrange practices and book praise rooms; lead
                practices; communicate with the members about costumes, schedules,
                and other logistics. Lastly, I organize the annual dance showcase by
                recruiting people who can help with sound, camera, and lights;
                contact with other international school dance teams to perform; book
